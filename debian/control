Description: FUSE filesystem for Media Transfer Protocol devices
 MTPfs is a FUSE filesystem that supports reading and writing from MTP (Media
 Transfer Protocol) devices, such as MP3 players, video players or digital
 cameras.

 In addition to revealing media files on the connected device, MTPfs exposes a
 virtual directory called "/Playlists" which contains the device's playlists as
 m3u files.
